    <h2>About Me!</h2>
    <p class="about">Hi! My name is Gabriela Garcia-Astolfi! I was born in Connecticut, but grew up in North New Jersey and often visits to New York City for most of my life. I come from a strong immigrant background; my father from Spain who came to the United States when he was 25. My mother's parents who are Italian came to the United States in the 1960s. Being the first generation on my father's side, and second generation on my mother's side to grow up somewhere other than Spain or Italy, culture is very important to me. I see it manifest in the ways I communicate, express, emote, and especially cook. </p>
    <p class="about">Photography is something I have always gravitated towards. Now, I still find myself taking pictures of things that just catch my eye, but I major in Communication Studies at American University. I consider myself a natural communicator and it seemed righ to major in it as well. I am also minoring in International Relations because I would like to combine both disciplines in my future career.</p>
    <p class="about">I take time to appreciate all different kinds of artforms like poetry and paintings. Now that art has become more accessible to people thanks to the internet and social media, I constantly look through my Instagram suggested for new art every day. Some of my favorite poets I discovered on Instagram are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mazadohta/?hl=en">Pavana Reddy</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/miaohki/?hl=en">Mia Ohki</a>, who both write about their cultures and their emotional ties to them. Some artists of the past that I have grown to love are <a href="https://www.gustav-klimt.com/The-Tree-Of-Life.jsp">Gustav Klimt</a> and <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/J3e8z">Gilles Ketting</a>. I draw inspiration from the ethereal essence from these works of art and attempt to capture them in daily life.</p>
